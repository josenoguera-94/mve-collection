This repository teaches how to develop for the Cloud for free, without an account and without a credit card, emulating AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud locally:

* ✅ **Free and account-less**: All technologies are free and do not require creating an account anywhere.
* **💯% compatible**: The code you develop locally is 100% compatible with the real Cloud.
* 📦 **Self-contained**: Each example is independent and includes everything necessary to run it.
* 🚀 **Ready to run**: Examples are ready to run without making code changes.
* 🐳 **Dockerized**: All have dockerized development environments.
* 🖥️ **Graphical interfaces**: Use of graphical tools to manage the local Cloud environment.
* 📖 **Well documented**: All examples are documented in English and Spanish.

> ⭐ **If you find this repository useful, please consider giving it a star!** It helps other developers find these examples and supports further development.

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Prerequisites:**
    1. [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) installed and running.
    2. [Dev Containers extension](vscode:extension/ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers) installed.

2. **Open an example:** Open an example folder (e.g., `src/aws-dynamo-db`) in VS Code.
3. **Reopen in Container:** Open the **Command Palette** (`F1` or `Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+P`) and select **Dev Containers: Reopen in Container**.
4. **Follow instructions:** Once the container is ready, follow the instructions in the example's `README.md`. Usually, it's just:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
